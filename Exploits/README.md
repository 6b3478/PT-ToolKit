| Perfusion | On Windows 7, Windows Server 2008R2, Windows 8, and Windows Server 2012, the registry key of the RpcEptMapper and DnsCache (7/2008R2 only) services is configured with weak permissions. Any local user can create a Performance subkey and then leverage the Windows Performance Counters to load an arbitrary DLL in the context of the WMI service as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM (hence the tool's name). | [itm4n](https://github.com/itm4n/Perfusion)
| PetitPotam |PoC tool to coerce Windows hosts to authenticate to other machines via MS-EFSRPC EfsRpcOpenFileRaw or other functions :) The tools use the LSARPC named pipe with inteface c681d488-d850-11d0-8c52-00c04fd90f7e because it's more prevalent. But it's possible to trigger with the EFSRPC named pipe and interface df1941c5-fe89-4e79-bf10-463657acf44d. It doesn't need credentials against Domain Controller | [topotam](https://github.com/topotam/PetitPotam)
