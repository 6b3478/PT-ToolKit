# ProxyShell-POC-Mod
A Proof of Concept for ProxyShell (CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021-34523, CVE-2021-31207) vulnerability.
This exploit code is a merge of two POC. They both had pros & cons; So I merged them.

## Motivation
I used both the above POC's in my lab. But I had some issues with them.
- [@donnymaasland](https://github.com/dmaasland/proxyshell-poc)'s version had a proxy which gave me back so much delay and errors
- [@ber_m1ng](https://github.com/ktecv2000/ProxyShell)'s version don't use EWS to put payload in Draft, Instead it sent payload via mail to inbox.
- To learn more about `ProxyShell` I decided to merge those codes; And it worked

## What's new?
- `X-Anchormailbox` header for Exchange 2016 support

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/aravazhimdr/ProxyShell-POC-Mod.git

virtualenv -p $(which python3) venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install pypsrp requests
cp wsman.py venv/lib/*/site-packages/pypsrp/wsman.py
```

__Note: This POC uses modified version of wsman.py from [@ber_m1ng](https://github.com/ktecv2000/ProxyShell)__
